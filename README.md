## Overview

Mindful AI leverages several state-of-the-art models and libraries to help users understand their emotional state. Using **Streamlit** as the frontend, it provides an interactive user interface that includes:

- **Voice Analysis:** Record your voice, transcribe audio with Whisper, and analyze sentiment with a transformer-based sentiment model.
- **Facial Detection:** Detect faces and annotate emotions using OpenCV and a pre-trained emotion classifier.
- **Heart Rate Monitoring:** Upload or stream heart rate data to visualize and analyze heart rate patterns.
- **AI Chat:** Chat with an AI assistant for personalized insights and emotional guidance.
- **Voice Chat:** Convert your voice into text, process it with an AI model, and listen to the AI-generated response using text-to-speech.

## Architecture

The project is built using the following libraries and frameworks:

- **Streamlit:** For creating the web application interface.
- **Transformers:** To load and run transformer models for sentiment analysis.
- **Whisper:** For automatic speech recognition.
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** For loading and running the emotion classification model.
- **OpenCV:** For image and video processing, including face detection.
- **Plotly:** To create interactive charts for heart rate monitoring.
- **Other Dependencies:** Including libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `uuid`, `tempfile`, and custom modules like `Sarvam_STT`, `Google_Translate`, and `tts_tutorial`.
